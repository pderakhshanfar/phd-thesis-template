\textbf{Threats to validity.}
We cannot guarantee that our implementation of \botsing is bug-free. However, we mitigated this threat by testing our tool and manually examining some samples of the results. 
We cannot ensure that our results are generalizable to all crashes. However, we used an earlier established benchmark for crash reproduction containing 124 hard-to-reproduce crashes provoked by real bugs in a variety of open-source applications. 
Moreover, by following the guidelines of the related literature \cite{Arcuri2014}, we executed each configuration 30 times to take the randomness of the search process into account.
Finally, we provide \botsing as an open-source tool. Also, the data and the processing scripts used to present the results are available as a replication package on Zenodo\cite{derakhshanfar_pouria_2020_3953519}.
