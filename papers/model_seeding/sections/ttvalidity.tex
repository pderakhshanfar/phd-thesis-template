\subsection{Threats to validity}\label{sec:model_seeding:ttvalidity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Internal validity}
We selected 122 crashes from 5 open source projects: 33 crashes have previously been studied \cite{Soltani2018b} and we added additional crashes from XWiki and Defects4J (see Section~\ref{sec:model_seeding:setup}). 
%
Since we focused on the effect of seeding during guided initialization, we fixed the $Pr[pick\ mut]$ value (which, due to the current implementation of \botsing, is also used as $Pr[pick\ init]$ value in test seeding) to 0.3, the default value used in \evosuite for unit test generation. The effect of this value for crash reproduction, as well as the usage of test and model seeding in guided initialization, is part of our future work.
%
We cannot guarantee that our extension of \botsing is free of defects. We mitigated this threat by testing the extension and manually analyzing a sample of the results.
%
Finally, each frame has been run 30 times for each seeding configuration to take randomness into account and we derive our conclusions based on standard statistical tests \cite{Arcuri2014,Panichella2017c}.

\subsubsection{External validity}
We cannot guarantee that our results are generalizable to all crashes. However, we used \jcrashpack, which is the most recent benchmark for Java crash reproduction. This benchmark is assembled carefully from seven Java projects and contains 200 real-life crashes. Since the \evosuite test executor is unsuccessful in running the existing test cases of one of the seven projects in \jcrashpack (ElasticSearch), thereby test seeding and dynamic analysis of model-seeding are not applicable on crashes of this project, we excluded ElasticSearch crashes from \jcrashpack. The diversity of crashes in this benchmark also suggests mitigation of this threat.

\subsubsection{Verifiability} 
A replication package of our empirical evaluation is available at \url{https://github.com/STAMP-project/ExRunner-bash/tree/master}. The complete results and analysis scripts are also provided as a dataset in Zenodo\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3673916}} for long-term storage. Our extension of \botsing is released under a LGPL 3.0 license and available at \url{https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing}.
